# **INFOSHEET: CONVERSATIONAL LABS**

## **Introduction**
Conversational studies in lab settings involve structured interactions designed to explore social dynamics, information processing, decision-making, and conflict resolution in controlled environments. 
Among these, focus groups and dyadic conversations are widely used for their ability to provide rich, interactive data. Focus groups allow for collective meaning-making where participants not only express opinions but also refine their perspectives through discussion (Bryman, 2012, pp. 513-514). Dyadic conversations, on the other hand, offer deep interpersonal insights, particularly useful for understanding joint decision-making and contrasting viewpoints.

Unlike controlled experiments, which seek to isolate variables and establish causality, conversational studies in lab settings don’t exert the same level of control. The setting is semi-structured, but the interactions naturally unfold when participants are placed in open-ended discussion environments.

# Study Design
Conversational studies typically include 2 (dyadic) or six to ten (focus groups) participants. Smaller groups may be preferable when discussing emotionally sensitive topics, while larger groups can be effective for broader discussions where participant engagement varies. 

When designing focus groups, discussions should follow a semi-structured question set (typically 5–10 key questions) that progresses from general to specific topics. Moderators should aim for a balanced approach, as excessive intervention may disrupt natural interactions, while too little may lead to unproductive discussions. Moderation should be minimal but adaptive, allowing discussions to flow freely while refocusing when necessary (Bryman, 2012, p. 508). 

In dyadic conversations, two participants engage in discussion based on a topic or set of instructions provided by the researcher. Dyads may be selected for complementary or opposing viewpoints: For example, pairing individuals with different stances on an issue or colleagues in distinct roles. The setting should be private and distraction-free, and participants should feel comfortable with their discussion partner. Unlike focus groups, the researcher does not actively moderate but instead provides structured prompts or scenarios. Props, prompts, and follow-up questions can help steer engagement and explore topics in depth. 

Successful focus groups and dyadic conversations require careful planning. As Bryman (2012, pp. 504–514) highlights, moderators should remain impartial, avoid influencing responses, and facilitate balanced participation while allowing discussions to flow naturally. Preparing props or prompts can help guide the discussion, and strategic interventions may be necessary to manage dominant speakers or bring quieter participants into the conversation (Bryman, 2012, p. 508).
Consult Bryman chapter 21 for more information on planning conversational studies, including informed consent, anonymization and ground rules of confidentiality, monitor for possible distress, and providing closure.

# Participant Sampling and Data Collection 
Participant recruitment should align with the research question, ensuring that selected individuals have relevant knowledge, demographic characteristics, or lived experiences. Bryman (2012, pp. 505–510) outlines various sampling strategies, including purposive sampling (selecting participants based on criteria), stratified sampling (ensuring subgroup representation), and convenience sampling. The choice between homogeneous groups (to encourage open discussion) and heterogeneous groups (to stimulate debate and contrasting perspectives) depends on the study’s objectives. Researchers must also decide between natural groups (pre-existing social ties) and randomly selected participants, each with its own advantages and challenges (Bryman, 2012, p. 510).

To ensure open participation, power imbalances should be avoided—for example, mixing employees with managers may inhibit honest responses. A brief screening survey can help balance participant composition, and sending confirmation and reminder messages can reduce no-show rates.


At KU DigiLabs, you can reserve one of the rooms to conduct conversational studies. For optimal audio quality, we recommend borrowing a Zoom recorder or another high-end omnidirectional microphone to ensure high-fidelity recordings. Additionally, using one or multiple video cameras will allow you to capture nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions and body language, providing deeper insights into participant interactions.

# Data analysis
After the sessions, recordings must be transcribed for analysis. Verbatim transcription is generally preferred, though filler words (e.g., “um,” “you know”) may be omitted unless speech patterns are relevant. Assigning pseudonyms or participant codes (e.g., P1, P2) ensures anonymity, and non-verbal cues such as [laughter] or [pause] provide additional context (Bryman, 2012, pp. 504–505). Automated transcription tools, such as WhisperTranscribe available at KU DigiLabs, can speed up the process, though manual correction is necessary due to potential errors in speaker differentiation and overlapping speech.

Analyzing conversational data involves coding transcripts to identify patterns and themes. Bryman (2012, pp. 576–578) outlines thematic analysis as a common approach, where statements are categorized based on meaning. For example, discussions about online learning may be coded into themes like social isolation (e.g., "lack of interaction") and convenience (e.g., "flexibility"). These codes are then grouped into broader themes to structure findings.
To ensure coding reliability, multiple researchers should review and refine codes (inter-coder agreement), a process facilitated by software such as NVivo (Bryman, 2012, p. 578). However, simpler methods, such as organizing quotes in spreadsheets, can also be effective.

Triangulation strengthens qualitative research by combining multiple data sources (Bryman, 2012, p. 586). In conversational labs, spoken content (transcripts) can be cross-validated with:
- Video analysis, which allows researchers to observe non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and body language. These behaviors can reveal underlying sentiments that might not be explicitly stated in conversation. At KU DigiLabs, researchers can use Observer XT to code and analyze these non-verbal interactions systematically.
- Prosodic speech analysis examines how participants speak. Changes in pitch, tone, speed, and stress can indicate emotional states that are difficult to detect from transcripts alone. For instance, an increase in pitch might suggest excitement or nervousness, while a slow and hesitant response could indicate uncertainty or reluctance. At KU DigiLabs, we use tools like WASP to analyze speech parameters.

While conversational studies are primarily qualitative, **descriptive statistics** (Stats1) can be used to count how often specific themes or behaviors occur. For example, if "trust in information" appears in 75% of transcripts, this suggests a recurring concern. Similarly, researchers can track the number of interruptions, speech duration, or expressions of hesitation to quantify engagement levels.
**Relational statistics** (Stats2 and Stats3) allow researchers to correlate different data sources. By analyzing whether certain themes in transcripts align with specific body language patterns or vocal stress markers, researchers can test hypotheses about participant confidence, uncertainty, or emotional responses. For instance, if discussions about misinformation consistently coincide with higher vocal pitch and increased speech rate, it might indicate anxiety or cognitive strain. 

## Example: Studying Co-Serendipity in Conversations

A past research study at the University of Copenhagen explored the concepts of co-interest and co-serendipity: How shared interest and unexpected discoveries emerge in conversation.

Research Design:
- The study involved six 30-minute recorded conversations between pairs of participants.
- Participants browsed through a set of five different magazines and discussed what sparked their interest and why.
- Sessions were video- and audio-recorded using a Logitech Webcam C930e and Morae software.
- A semi-structured interview followed each session, concluding with an empathy test.

Findings:
- Co-interest occurs when two individuals share a spontaneous interest triggered by environmental factors.
- Co-serendipity happens when one person unexpectedly discovers something engaging and shares it with another, who also finds it interesting.
- Observable signs included increased speech activity, smiling, and prosodic shifts in conversation.
- Participants' empathy levels might influence how receptive they are to interest triggers.

## Example: The Intractable Conflict Lab
At Columbia University’s Intractable Conflict Lab, researchers study real-time interactions between individuals engaged in polarizing moral conflicts.

Research Design:
- Participants are matched based on opposing views on controversial topics such as affirmative action or reproductive rights.
- Each pair engages in a 20-minute conversation aimed at reaching a joint position statement.
- Discussions are video- and audio-recorded for later analysis.
- Participants then review their own conversation, providing feedback on emotional intensity and perceived changes in understanding.

Findings:
- Some discussions escalate into entrenched positions, while others remain open and constructive.
- More constructive conversations exhibit higher cognitive complexity, where participants acknowledge and integrate multiple perspectives.
- Emotional regulation plays a key role in whether conflicts remain tractable or spiral into intractability.
- Structural elements, such as pre-discussion framing and cognitive priming, can influence whether participants engage in black-and-white thinking or nuanced reasoning (Kugler & Coleman, 2020).
