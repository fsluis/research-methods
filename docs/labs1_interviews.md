## Introduction
Semi-structured interviews are qualitative in nature and rely on asking questions within a predetermined thematic framework. They are the most widely employed method in qualitative research, acting as an exploratory tool in marketing, social science, survey methodology, and other research fields.

Semi-structured interviews are often open-ended, allowing for flexibility and providing in-depth insights into specific topics. The method balances structure with flexibility and exploration, enabling interviewers to probe deeper into responses, uncovering rich, qualitative data that might not emerge in more structured formats.

Compared to quantitative surveys, interviews allow for clarification, follow-ups, and deeper exploration of responses and complex issues. At the same time, interviews can also be time-consuming, requiring transcription, coding and a detailed analysis.

## Designing Interviews
Qualitative interviewing is highly flexible and focuses on how the interviewee frames and understands issues and events. A common approach for designing interviews is the semi-structured interview. Here, the researchers uses a list of questions or specific topics to be covered. However, the interviewee still has a great deal of leeway in how to reply. This will most likely create an implicit tension between what you want to know and what the interviewee cares and wants to talk about. Thus, an important skill for an interviewer is to be a good listener that actively listens to the interviewees and picks up on important points that arise during the interview. A skill that has been described by Small and Calarco (2022) as cognitive empathy.

When designing an interview guide, Bryman discusses several basic elements that will help you to build an interview guide:

- formulate your interview questions in a way that help you to answer your research question
- try to use a language that is comprehensive and relevant to the people you are interviewing
- do not ask leading questions
- create a certain amount of order in your interview questions, so that your questions about them flow well
- be prepared to alter the order of your questions during the interview

In the interview guide you can ask about different kinds of things, such as beliefs, values, behavior, relationships, emotions, encounters or stories. You can consider doing something special, like having your interviewee sort cards as part of the interview (Conrad, 2019), or use ‘props’ to steer a conversation. 

Typically your interview guide will consists of different types of questions. Bryman mentions here nine types of questions that you will likely incorporate in your interview guide:

- Introducing (“Tell me about...”)  
- Follow-up (“What do you mean by that?”)  
- Probing (“Could you tell me more about...?)  
- Specifying (“What did you do then?”)  
- Direct (“Do you think that...?”)  
- Indirect (“What do most people think about...?”)  
- Structuring (“Let’s move on to...”)  
- Silence  
- Interpreting (“Do you mean that...?”)

Keep in mind that these interview questions will vary depending on the current stage of your interview.

## Conducting Interviews at KU DigiLabs
At DigiLabs, you can conduct both individual and group interviews in a controlled setting. This setting will help you to find a quiet setting (so there is no or little outside noise that might affect the quality of your interview and recording) and private (so that interviewees do not have to worry about being overheard).

We recommend borrowing a Zoom recorder or another high-quality microphone for clear audio capture. Also, make sure you are familiar with your equipment before beginning the interviews. This will help you to pay attention to the way how people talk about certain topics and will also help you with transcribing your interviews later.

Before you conduct your interviews in the DigiLabs, assign roles to each other: Who will lead the interview, and who will be the observer? The interviewer guides the conversation, follows the interview guide, and ensures a natural flow. The observer takes notes on non-verbal behavior, conversation dynamics, and interviewee responses. 

After each session, debriefing helps reflect on key insights, unexpected findings, and interactional patterns (Bryman, 2012, p. 225). You can take notes about:

- how well the interview went (was the interviewee talkative, cooperative, nervous etc.?)
- where the interview took place
- any other feelings about the interview (did it open up new avenues of interest?)
- the setting (busy/quiet, many/few people in the vicinity etc.?)
- any surprising elements

## Data analysis
After each interview, transfer the recorded interviews to a computer and transcribe them, ensuring accuracy through proofreading, speaker designations, and timestamps. If conducting group interviews, pay special attention to interactional patterns. Combine your transcripts with your observations.

For data analysis, thematic coding is a widely used approach. Braun and Clarke’s method of inductive thematic analysis offers a structured way to identify recurring ideas and patterns. Researchers should generate initial codes by marking relevant text segments, keeping them close to the data (Bryman, 2012, p. 580). Similar codes should be grouped into potential themes, refined through discussion, and structured to ensure coherence and depth. To ensure inter-rater reliability, have multiple researchers code a subset independently, compare results, and resolve discrepancies by revisiting the data or refining definitions collaboratively.
For the lab weeks, you can use card sorting to structure themes and identify relationships (Conrad and Tucker, 2019). This technique can help you to start deeper participant reflections and generate rich data sets to increase understanding. Thereby, defining and naming your final themes clearly, ensuring they provide meaningful insights. To document your analysis process and your resulting codes, you can use summary statistics (see Stats1). These summary statistics can be supported by direct quotes, moving beyond description to explain how themes connect and what they reveal.

Triangulation strengthens qualitative research by combining multiple data sources (Bryman, 2012, p. 586). In interview studies, spoken content (transcripts) can be cross-validated with:
- Video analysis, which allows researchers to observe non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and body language. These behaviors can reveal underlying sentiments that might not be explicitly stated in conversation. At KU DigiLabs, researchers can use Observer XT to code and analyze these non-verbal interactions systematically.
- Prosodic speech analysis examines how participants speak. Changes in pitch, tone, speed, and stress can indicate emotional states that are difficult to detect from transcripts alone. For instance, an increase in pitch might suggest excitement or nervousness, while a slow and hesitant response could indicate uncertainty or reluctance. At KU DigiLabs, we use tools like WASP to analyze speech parameters.

While interview studies are primarily qualitative, **descriptive statistics** (Stats1) can be used to count how often specific themes or behaviors occur. For example, if "trust in information" appears in 75% of transcripts, this suggests a recurring concern. Similarly, researchers can track the number of interruptions, speech duration, or expressions of hesitation to quantify engagement levels.
**Relational statistics** (Stats2 and Stats3) allow researchers to correlate different data sources. By analyzing whether certain themes in transcripts align with specific body language patterns or vocal stress markers, researchers can test hypotheses about participant confidence, uncertainty, or emotional responses. For instance, if discussions about misinformation consistently coincide with higher vocal pitch and increased speech rate, it might indicate anxiety or cognitive strain.

## Example Study: Collaboration in Data-Intensive Research Networks

This study explores how Ph.D. fellows in wind energy research networks navigate collaboration challenges and expectations in interdisciplinary, data-intensive environments. Given the reliance on shared data, infrastructure, and international teams, collaboration is crucial yet complex.

Methodology:
Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 Ph.D. fellows across four research networks, analyzing responses through inductive thematic analysis and card sorting. Participants discussed knowledge sharing, network interactions, and institutional support, with themes refined collaboratively through investigator triangulation.

Key Findings:
- Collaboration is a balancing act between institutional goals, network demands, and personal priorities.
- Optimistic expectations contrast with the realities of coordinating interdisciplinary work.
- Data defines collaboration, influencing partnerships and dependencies.
- Physical meetings remain essential for building trust, despite reliance on digital tools.

Relevance:
This study demonstrates how semi-structured interviews and inductive analysis can reveal social dynamics in research collaborations. The card sorting method provides a structured way to develop themes from qualitative data, making it a valuable approach for analyzing group discussions and professional interactions in lab settings.
