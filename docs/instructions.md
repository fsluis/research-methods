# ACTIVE PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENT 2: LAB WEEKS ASSIGNMENT

## Learning Methods in Practice: Group Project Assignment

Welcome to Lab Weeks! During this part of the course, you will explore a specific method used in communication and cognition research by trying it out yourself in a small group. The goal of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience with one method, reflect on its strengths and weaknesses, and share your insights with the rest of the class. This will culminate in a poster presentation at the end of the Lab Weeks.

## Instructions

### 1. Group Formation

You will be placed in groups of approximately 4–6 students. Each group will focus on one method. We will assign methods based on your preferences where possible.

### 2. Method Selection

Each group will explore one research method. Examples include interviews, conversation analysis, experiments, eye tracking, and content analysis. Each method is described in an **infosheet**, available on Absalon. Please read your method’s infosheet carefully. It includes resources, tools, tips, and reading suggestions to help you get started.

## Assignment Phases

Your assignment will follow three main phases:

### Phase 1: Study Design

Your group should collaboratively plan how to use the selected method. Define a simple study question or focus, and clarify what kind of data you will collect. You do not need to design a comprehensive study, rather keep it simple. The aim is to understand how the method works in practice. Be sure to pilot test your study!

### Phase 2: Data Sampling and Collection

Test the method by collecting a small sample of data. You can use a real participant (e.g., a volunteer from another group), and online data in the case of content analysis.  The aim is to experience the method’s workflow and data-gathering process. Be ethical and respectful, and get informal consent if you're involving others.

### Phase 3: Data Analysis and Reporting

Analyze your collected data to the extent that it makes sense for your method. This could involve coding, categorization, visualization, interpretation, or software-based analysis. All methods are expected to use some form of statistics, the individual infosheets give suggestions as to what might be applicable.

## Poster Presentation with Appendix

At the end of Lab Weeks, your group will present your findings and reflections in the form of a poster. This is your chance to share what you’ve learned and teach your classmates about the method you explored.

Your poster should include the following:

- A short **introduction** to the method
- A description of your **test or mini-study**, organized around the phases: study design, data sampling and collection, and data analysis and results
- Reflections on **strengths, limitations, and lessons learned**
- A **critical reflection** on the method’s validity, reliability, and ethical considerations, supported by relevant literature

You are encouraged to include visuals, mock-ups of your data, screenshots, or quotes from your process. The poster does not need to comprehensively report “results” in the traditional sense — the emphasis is on practical understanding.

Reflect critically on your process and the method as a whole: What worked well? What challenges did you face? What would you do differently in a real research setting? Consider validity, reliability, and ethical implications.

We will organize a poster walk where each group presents their method and discusses it with classmates. Be prepared to explain what you did and answer questions.

Many details about your study method won't fit on your paper, but it is nonetheless a good practice to document clearly all the choices made and actions taken during the different phases. As an appendix / handout to your poster presentation, also prepare a short handout that documents all your steps. Consider the level of detail needed to make your study reproducible - so your peers could run it and achieve the same (or not?) results.

## Submission

Your poster+appendix will be submitted to Absalon and shared with the class as a learning resource.

Have fun exploring, experimenting, and learning. This is your chance to test an advanced method and reflect on what research looks like in practice!
